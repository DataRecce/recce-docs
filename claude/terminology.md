# Recce Documentation Terminology Guide

This guide helps maintain consistent, data-team-friendly language across all Recce documentation.

## Core Philosophy

**Data teams think data-first, code-second.** Our terminology should reflect their mental models and avoid software engineering jargon that creates confusion.

## Preferred Terminology

### Recce-Specific Terms

| **Use This** | **Not This** | **Context** |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Recce instance** | Recce server, Recce app | The UI launched by `recce server` |
| **data validation** | data testing, data quality checks | Primary concept for what Recce does |
| **validation results** | diff output, comparison data | What users see in Recce |
| **impact analysis** | dependency analysis, lineage | Understanding downstream effects |
| **data changes** | code changes, model changes | What users are validating |
| **code change** | code modification | Specific term for data team workflows |
| **validation workflow** | testing workflow, QA process | How teams use Recce |
| **diff** | comparison, delta | Data teams familiar with git diff, use freely |
| **Recce**| recce | this is the brand name, should always use "Recce" | 
| **dbt** | DBT | this is the brand name, should always use lower cases| 


### Data vs Software Terms

| **Data Team Friendly** | **Software Term** | **Why Different** |
|------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **data warehouse** | database | Data teams distinguish warehouses from operational databases |
| **development stage** | environment | "Environment" confuses (warehouse vs dev/prod) |
| **data models** | components | dbt models vs software components |
| **model** | node | Data teams think "model", software teams think "node" |
| **release changes** | deploy | Data teams "release" changes, don't "deploy" infrastructure |
| **validation checks** | unit tests | Data quality checks vs code functionality tests |
| **automated validation** | CI/CD pipeline | Data processing vs deployment automation |
| **change review** | code review | Reviewing data changes vs code changes |
| **diff** | comparison | Data teams understand diff from git/version control |

### Business Impact Language

| **Business Focused** | **Technical Focused** | **Impact** |
|---------------------|----------------------|------------|
| **build trust** | ensure quality | Emphasizes outcome over process |
| **catch issues early** | prevent bugs | Prevention focus, business consequences |
| **confident releases** | successful deployments | User empowerment over technical success |
| **team collaboration** | workflow integration | People-first over tool-first |
| **validate changes** | test modifications | Active validation vs passive testing |

## Terms That Confuse Data Teams

### üö® High Confusion Terms

**Environment**
- **Data team thinks**: Snowflake vs BigQuery warehouse
- **Software team thinks**: dev/staging/prod deployment target
- **‚úÖ Use instead**: "development stage" or "dbt target"

**Deploy**
- **Data team thinks**: Infrastructure deployment (not their job)
- **Software team thinks**: Release code changes
- **‚úÖ Use instead**: "release changes" or "make live"

**Pipeline**
- **Data team thinks**: Data transformation workflow (dbt run)
- **Software team thinks**: CI/CD automation workflow
- **‚úÖ Use instead**: "data pipeline" vs "automation workflow"

**Testing**
- **Data team thinks**: Data quality validation
- **Software team thinks**: Unit/integration tests for code
- **‚úÖ Use instead**: "validation" or "data quality checks"

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium Confusion Terms

**Model**
- **Data context**: dbt data model (SQL transformation)
- **Software context**: Software component or data structure
- **‚úÖ Clarify**: Always use "dbt model" or "data model"

**Schema** 
- **Data context**: Database schema (namespace for tables)
- **Software context**: Data structure definition
- **‚úÖ Clarify**: "database schema" vs "data structure"

**Target**
- **Data context**: dbt profile target (dev/prod warehouse config)
- **Software context**: Deployment target or goal
- **‚úÖ Clarify**: "dbt target" when referring to profiles.yml

## Terminology Alert System

When reviewing documentation, flag confusing terms with this format:

```
‚ö†Ô∏è **Terminology Alert**: [TERM]
- **Confusion risk**: [Why data teams might misunderstand]
- **Current usage**: [How it appears in content]
- **Suggested clarification**: [Better phrasing or explanation]
- **Context needed**: [When to add explanation]
```

### Examples

```
‚ö†Ô∏è **Terminology Alert**: "Deploy your changes"
- **Confusion risk**: Data teams think infrastructure deployment
- **Current usage**: "Deploy your dbt changes to production"
- **Suggested clarification**: "Release your data changes to production"
- **Context needed**: Always in data change contexts
```

```
‚ö†Ô∏è **Terminology Alert**: "Test environment" 
- **Confusion risk**: Could mean test warehouse vs test deployment stage
- **Current usage**: "Run Recce in your test environment"
- **Suggested clarification**: "Run Recce against your development data warehouse"
- **Context needed**: When referring to data warehouse setup
```

## Clarification Patterns

### Pattern 1: Define on First Use
```markdown
Recce validates your **data changes** (modifications to dbt models, seeds, or configurations) before they impact production.
```

### Pattern 2: Use Data Analogies
```markdown
Just like code reviews catch bugs before production, data validation catches issues before they affect business metrics.
```

### Pattern 3: Contrast Software vs Data
```markdown
While software teams deploy applications, data teams release model changes to their warehouse.
```

### Pattern 4: Add Contextual Clarifiers
```markdown
Configure your dbt target (the warehouse connection in profiles.yml) to point to your development environment.
```

## Maintenance Guidelines

### Adding New Terms
When introducing new terminology:
1. **Check for confusion potential** - Could data teams misunderstand?
2. **Define immediately** - Explain on first use
3. **Use consistently** - Same term for same concept throughout
4. **Add to this guide** - Update the preferred terminology table

### Regular Reviews
- **Monthly**: Review user questions for terminology confusion
- **Quarterly**: Update based on support feedback and user research
- **Major releases**: Ensure new features use data-team-friendly language

### Quality Checks
Before publishing, verify:
- [ ] **No undefined jargon** - All technical terms explained
- [ ] **Consistent usage** - Same term used throughout
- [ ] **Data team perspective** - Language matches their mental models
- [ ] **Context provided** - Clarification when terms could be ambiguous

## Quick Reference: Common Replacements

| **Instead of...** | **Use...** | **Context** |
|------------------|------------|-------------|
| "Deploy changes" | "Release changes" | Data modifications |
| "Test your models" | "Validate your models" | Data quality checking |
| "Environment setup" | "Warehouse connection setup" | Database configuration |
| "CI/CD pipeline" | "Automated validation workflow" | Recce automation |
| "Unit tests" | "Model validation checks" | dbt testing |
| "Production deployment" | "Production release" | Making changes live |
| "Development environment" | "Development warehouse" | Where you develop |
| "Code review" | "Change review" | Reviewing data modifications |

**Remember**: When in doubt, choose the term that a data analyst (not a software engineer) would immediately understand. Clarity builds trust and reduces barriers to adoption.
