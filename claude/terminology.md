# Recce Documentation Terminology Guide

This guide helps maintain consistent, data-team-friendly language across all Recce documentation.

## Core Philosophy

**Data teams think data-first, code-second.** Our terminology should reflect their mental models and avoid software engineering jargon that creates confusion.

## Preferred Terminology

### Recce-Specific Terms

| **Use This** | **Not This** | **Context** |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Recce instance** | Recce server, Recce app | The UI launched by `recce server` |
| **data validation** | data testing, data quality checks | Primary concept for what Recce does |
| **validation results** | diff output, comparison data | What users see in Recce |
| **impact analysis** | dependency analysis, lineage | Understanding downstream effects |
| **data changes** | code changes, model changes | What users are validating |
| **code change** | code modification | Specific term for data team workflows |
| **validation workflow** | testing workflow, QA process | How teams use Recce |
| **diff** | comparison, delta | Data teams familiar with git diff, use freely |

| **Recce**| recce | this is the brand name, should always use "Recce" | 
| **dbt** | DBT | this is the brand name, should always use lower cases| 


### Data vs Software Terms

| **Data Team Friendly** | **Software Term** | **Why Different** |
|------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **data warehouse** | database | Data teams distinguish warehouses from operational databases |
| **development stage** | environment | "Environment" confuses (warehouse vs dev/prod) |
| **data models** | components | dbt models vs software components |
| **model** | node | Data teams think "model", software teams think "node" |
| **release changes** | deploy | Data teams "release" changes, don't "deploy" infrastructure |
| **validation checks** | unit tests | Data quality checks vs code functionality tests |
| **automated validation** | CI/CD pipeline | Data processing vs deployment automation |
| **change review** | code review | Reviewing data changes vs code changes |
| **diff** | comparison | Data teams understand diff from git/version control |
| **artifacts** | build outputs | dbt manifest.json, catalog.json files |
| **run dbt** | execute dbt, build models | Preferred: "run dbt" not "execute" or "build" |
| **materialization** | table creation strategy | How dbt creates tables (table, view, incremental) |

## Terminology Alert System

When reviewing documentation, flag confusing terms with this format:

```
‚ö†Ô∏è **Terminology Alert**: [TERM]
- **Confusion risk**: [Why data teams might misunderstand]
- **Current usage**: [How it appears in content]
- **Suggested clarification**: [Better phrasing or explanation]
- **Context needed**: [When to add explanation]
```

### Examples

```
‚ö†Ô∏è **Terminology Alert**: "Deploy your changes"
- **Confusion risk**: Data teams think infrastructure deployment
- **Current usage**: "Deploy your dbt changes to production"
- **Suggested clarification**: "Release your data changes to production"
- **Context needed**: Always in data change contexts
```

```
‚ö†Ô∏è **Terminology Alert**: "Test environment" 
- **Confusion risk**: Could mean test warehouse vs test deployment stage
- **Current usage**: "Run Recce in your test environment"
- **Suggested clarification**: "Run Recce against your development data warehouse"
- **Context needed**: When referring to data warehouse setup
```

## Clarification Patterns

### Pattern 1: Define on First Use
```markdown
Recce validates your **data changes** (modifications to dbt models, seeds, or configurations) before they impact production.
```

### Pattern 2: Use Data Analogies
```markdown
Just like code reviews catch bugs before production, data validation catches issues before they affect business metrics.
```

### Pattern 3: Contrast Software vs Data
```markdown
While software teams deploy applications, data teams release model changes to their warehouse.
```

### Pattern 4: Add Contextual Clarifiers
```markdown
Configure your dbt target (the warehouse connection in profiles.yml) to point to your development environment.
```

## Conflicting Usage Patterns

These terms are used inconsistently across the documentation, creating potential confusion. Document conflicts here without changing the content immediately.

### üîÄ Terms Used Inconsistently

**"Environment" vs "Target" vs "Workspace"**
- **Data team perspective**: "Target" refers to dbt profiles.yml config, "Environment" means warehouse type (Snowflake vs BigQuery)
- **Software team perspective**: "Environment" means dev/staging/prod deployment context
- **Current usage in docs**: Mixed usage - sometimes "environment" for dbt targets, sometimes for deployment stages
- **Recommendation**: Use "dbt target" for profiles.yml, "development workspace" for where analysts work

**"Check" vs "Validation" vs "Test"**
- **Data team perspective**: "Validation" sounds more professional than "testing", "checks" are specific validations
- **Software team perspective**: "Tests" are automated code verification, "checks" are CI/CD gates
- **Current usage in docs**: Mixed - "preset checks", "validation workflow", "test your models"
- **Recommendation**: Standardize on "validation" for data quality, "checks" for specific validation rules

**"Build" vs "Run" vs "Execute"**
- **Data team perspective**: "Run dbt" is the standard command, "build" sounds like compiling code
- **Software team perspective**: "Build" means compile/package, "execute" means run program
- **Current usage in docs**: Mixed usage - "build your models", "run dbt", "execute transformations"
- **Recommendation**: Use "run" for dbt operations, avoid "build" and "execute"

**"Review" vs "Audit" vs "Validation"**
- **Data team perspective**: "Review" is collaborative, "audit" is formal compliance checking
- **Software team perspective**: "Review" is code review process, "audit" is security scanning
- **Current usage in docs**: "Review mode", "change review", "validation workflow"
- **Recommendation**: Use "review" for collaborative processes, "validation" for automated checks

**"Pipeline" vs "Workflow"**
- **Data team perspective**: "Pipeline" means data transformation flow (dbt models)
- **Software team perspective**: "Pipeline" means CI/CD automation pipeline
- **Current usage in docs**: "CI/CD pipeline", "validation workflow", "automation workflow"
- **Recommendation**: "Data pipeline" for transformations, "automation workflow" for CI/CD

**"Deploy" vs "Release" vs "Publish"**
- **Data team perspective**: "Release" means making changes live, "deploy" sounds like infrastructure
- **Software team perspective**: "Deploy" means publish application, "release" means version release
- **Current usage in docs**: Mixed - "deploy changes", "release changes", "publish results"
- **Recommendation**: Use "release" for data changes, "deploy" only for infrastructure

## Maintenance Guidelines

### Adding New Terms
When introducing new terminology:
1. **Check for confusion potential** - Could data teams misunderstand?
2. **Define immediately** - Explain on first use
3. **Use consistently** - Same term for same concept throughout
4. **Add to this guide** - Update the preferred terminology table

### Regular Reviews
- **Monthly**: Review user questions for terminology confusion
- **Quarterly**: Update based on support feedback and user research
- **Major releases**: Ensure new features use data-team-friendly language

### Quality Checks
Before publishing, verify:
- [ ] **No undefined jargon** - All technical terms explained
- [ ] **Consistent usage** - Same term used throughout
- [ ] **Data team perspective** - Language matches their mental models
- [ ] **Context provided** - Clarification when terms could be ambiguous
