The Lineage Diff is the main interface to Recce and allows you to quickly see the potential area of impact from your dbt data modeling changes.

## Lineage Diff

It's from the Lineage Diff that you will determine which models to investigate further; and also perform the various data validation checks that will serve as proof-of-correctness of your work.

### Node Summary

![](../assets/images/features/node.png){: .shadow}

Models are color-coded to indicate their **status**:

- `Added` models are green.
- `Removed` models are red.
- `Modified` models are orange.

The two icons at the bottom right of each node indicate if a `row count` or `schema` change has been detected. Grayed out icons indicate no change.

<figure markdown>
  ![Model with Schema Change detected](../assets/images/features/model-schema-change-detected.png){: .shadow}
  <figcaption>Model with Schema Change detected</figcaption>
</figure>

**Note**: A row count changed icon is only shown if there is row count diff executed on this node.

<figure markdown>
  ![Open node details panel](../assets/images/features/node-details-panel.gif){: .shadow}
  <figcaption>Open the node details panel</figcaption>
</figure>

Click a model to open the [node details](#node-detail) panel and perform other data validation checks.

### Filter Nodes

In the top control bar, you can change the rule to filter the nodes:

1. **Mode:**
   - **Changed Models:** Modified nodes and their downstream + 1st degree of their parents.
   - **All:** Show all nodes.
1. **Package:** Filter by dbt package names.
1. **Select:** Select nodes by [node selection](./node-selection.md).
1. **Exclude:** Exclude nodes by [node selection](./node-selection.md).

### Select Nodes

Click a node to select it, or click the **Select nodes** button in the top-right corner to select multiple nodes for further operations. For detail, see the [Multi Nodes Selections](#multi-nodes-selection) section

### Row Count Diff

A row count diff can be performed on nodes selected using the `select` and `exclude` options:

![](../assets/images/features/row-count-diff-selector.gif){: .shadow}

After selecting nodes, run the row count diff by:

1. Clicking the 3 dots (**...**) button in the top-right corner.
2. Clicking **Row Count Diff by Selector**.

## Node Details

The node details panel shows information about a node, such as node type, schema and row count changes, and allows you to perform diffs on the node using the options accessed via the `Explore Change` button.

### Schema Diff

Schema Diff shows added, removed, and renamed columns. Click a model in the Lineage Diff to open the node details and view the Schema Diff.

!!! Note

    Schema Diff requires `catalog.json` in both environments.

<figure markdown>
  ![Recce Schema Diff](../assets/images/features/schema-diff.gif){: .shadow}
  <figcaption>Schema Diff</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure markdown>
  ![Recce Schema Diff](../assets/images/features/schema-diff.png)
  <figcaption>Schema Diff showing renamed column</figcaption>
</figure>

### Row Count Diff

Row Count Diff shows the difference in row count between the base and current environments.

1. Click the model in the Lineage DAG.
2. Click the `Explore Change` button in the node details panel.
3. Click `Row Count Diff`.

<figure markdown>
  ![Recce Row Count Diff - Single model](../assets/images/features/row-count-diff-single.gif){: .shadow}
  <figcaption>Row Count Diff - Single model</figcaption>
</figure>

### Code Diff

Code Diff shows the model code that has changed for a particular model.

![Code diff](../assets/images/features/code-diff.png)

1. Click the model in the Lineage DAG.
2. Click the `Explore Change` button in the node details panel.
3. Click `Code Diff`.

### Value Diff

Value Diff shows the matched count and percentage for each column in the table. It uses the primary key(s) to uniquely identify the records between the model in both environments.

The primary key is automatically inferred by the first column with the [unique](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-properties/data-tests#unique) test. If no primary key is detected at least one column is required to be specified as the primary key.

<figure markdown>
  ![Recce Value Diff](../assets/images/features/value-diff.png)
  <figcaption>Value Diff</figcaption>
</figure>

- **Added**: Newly added PKs.
- **Removed**: Removed PKs.
- **Matched**: For a column, the count of matched value of common PKs.
- **Matched %**: For a column, the ratio of matched over common PKs.

View mismatched values at the row level by clicking the `show mismatched values` option on a column name:

![](../assets/images/features/value-diff-detail.gif){: .shadow}

#### SQL Execution

Value Diff generates SQL queries using Jinja templates to compare data between your base and current environments. The queries perform a FULL OUTER JOIN on primary keys to identify added, removed, and mismatched records.

You can review the exact SQL templates in the [ValueDiffTask class](https://github.com/DataRecce/recce/blob/main/recce/tasks/valuediff.py#L80).

### Profile Diff

Profile Diff compares the basic statistic (e.g. count, distinct count, min, max, average) for each column in models between two environments.

1. Select the model from the Lineage DAG.
2. Click the `Expore Change` button.
3. Click `Profile Diff`.

#### SQL Execution

Profile Diff generates SQL queries using Jinja templates to calculate statistical measures for each column in your models. The queries analyze data distribution, null values, uniqueness, and numerical statistics.

You can review the exact [SQL templates](https://github.com/DataRecce/recce/blob/main/recce/tasks/profile.py#L14).

<figure markdown>
  ![Recce Profile Diff](../assets/images/features/profile-diff.png)
  <figcaption>Profile Diff</figcaption>
</figure>

The Statistics:

- Row count
- Not null proportion
- Distinct proportion
- Distinct count
- Is unique
- Minimum
- Maximum
- Average
- Median

### Histogram Diff

Histogram Diff compares the distribution of a numeric column in an overlay histogram chart.

<figure markdown>
  ![Recce Histogram Diff](../assets/images/features/histogram-diff.png)
  <figcaption>Histogram Diff</figcaption>
</figure>

A Histogram Diff can be generated in two ways.

**Via the Explore Change button menu:**

1. Select the model from the Lineage DAG.
2. Click the `Explore Change` button.
3. Click `Histogram Diff`.
4. Select a column to diff.
5. Click `Execute`.

**Via the column options menu:**

1. Select the model from the Lineage DAG.
2. Hover over the column in the Node Details panel.
3. Click the vertical 3 dots `...`
4. Click `Histogram Diff`.

<figure markdown>
  ![Generate a Recce Histogram Diff ](../assets/images/features/histogram-diff.gif){: .shadow}
  <figcaption>Generate a Recce Histogram Diff from the column options</figcaption>
</figure>

#### SQL Execution

Histogram Diff generates SQL queries to create distribution histograms for numeric and date columns. The queries use binning strategies to group values and count occurrences in each bin, supporting both integer and floating-point data types.

You can review the exact SQL generation functions in the [HistogramDiffTask class](https://github.com/DataRecce/recce/blob/main/recce/tasks/histogram.py#L160).

### Top-K Diff

Top-K Diff compares the distribution of a categorical column. The top 10 elements are shown by default, which can be expanded to the top 50 elements.

<figure markdown>
  ![Recce Top-K Diff](../assets/images/features/top-k-diff.png)
  <figcaption>Recce Top-K Diff</figcaption>
</figure>

A Top-K Diff can be generated in two ways.

**Via the Explore Change button menu:**

1. Select the model from the Lineage DAG.
2. Click the `Explore Change` button.
3. Click `Top-K Diff`.
4. Select a column to diff.
5. Click `Execute`.

**Via the column options menu:**

1. Select the model from the Lineage DAG.

<figure markdown>
  ![Generate a Recce Top-K Diff ](../assets/images/features/top-k-diff.gif){: .shadow}
  <figcaption>Generate a Recce Top-K Diff </figcaption>
</figure>

#### SQL Execution

Top-K Diff generates SQL queries using FULL OUTER JOIN to compare the most frequent values in categorical columns between environments. The queries group by column values and count occurrences to identify the top K categories.

You can review the exact SQL templates in the [TopKDiffTask class](https://github.com/DataRecce/recce/blob/main/recce/tasks/top_k.py#L15).

## Multi-Node Selection

Multiple nodes can be selected in the Lineage DAG. This enables actions to be performed on multiple nodes at the same time such as Row Count Diff, or Value Diff.

### Select Nodes Individually

To select multiple nodes individually, click the checkbox on the nodes you wish to select.

<figure markdown>
  ![Select multiple nodes individually](../assets/images/features/multi-node-selection.gif){: .shadow}
  <figcaption>Select multiple nodes individually</figcaption>
</figure>

### Select Parent or Child nodes

To select a node and all of its parents or children:

1. Click the checkbox on the node.
2. Right-click the node.
3. Click to select either parent or child nodes.

<figure markdown>
  ![Select a node and its parents or children](../assets/images/features/select-node-children.gif){: .shadow}

!!! Note

    FireFox does not support to copy image to clipboard. Recce show a modal instead. You can download the image to local or right-click on the image to copy the image.

## Add to Checklist

The Recce Checklist provides a way to record the results of a data check during change exploration. The purpose of adding Checks to the Checklist is to enable you to:

- Save Checks with notes of your interpretation of the data.
- Re-run checks following further data modeling changes.
- Share Checks as part of PR or stakeholder review.

### Schema and Lineage Diff

From the Lineage DAG, click the Actions dropdown menu and click Lineage Diff or Schema Diff from the Add to Checklist section. This will add:

- Lineage Diff: The current Lineage view, dependent on your <a href="#select-nodes">node selection</a> options.
- Schema Diff: A diff of all nodes if none are selected, or specific <a href="#multi-node-selection">selected nodes</a>.
