# Start your Data Reconnaissance Mission

## What is `Recce`?

`Recce` is a data-change validation tool for [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/) projects. `Recce` provides a convenient platform to perform cross-environment diffs as data modeling validations. Use these validations in your pull request (PR) comment to demonstrate proof-of-correctness of your modeling changes and speed up thew QA process of PR review.



## The definition of `Recce`
`Recce` (/ˈrɛki/), pronounced 'reh-kee', is short for 'reconnaissance'. We chose this name as it's the perfect fit for a tool you'll use to perform data reconnaissance to discover and assess the impact of data modeling changes. Add a `Data Recce` to your pull request workflow and stop pushing breaking changes to production.
