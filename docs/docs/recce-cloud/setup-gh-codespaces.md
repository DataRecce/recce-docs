!!! Note

    Recce Cloud is currently in **private alpha** and scheduled for general availability later this year.  [Sign up](../../cloud.md#signup) to the Recce newsletter to be notified, or email [product@datarecce.io](mailto:product@datarecce.io) to join our design partnership program for early access.

GitHub Codespaces is a development environment provided by GitHub that allows developers to have identical and isolated environments for development. The GitHub Codespaces uses VS Code Server technology. We can launch it from a GitHub pull request page, and once it is started, the Recce instance will run and port forwarding will be set up.

## Setup Recce Cloud in GitHub Codespaces

1. Prepare the two files in your repository
    ```
    .devcontainer
    └── recce
        ├── Dockerfile
        └── devcontainer.json
    ```

    !!! Tip 

        You can place the devcontainer configuration in [any valid location for Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/adding-a-dev-container-configuration/introduction-to-dev-containers#creating-a-custom-dev-container-configuration). However, Recce Cloud will prioritize using `.devcontainer/recce/devcontainer.json` if it is available.

1. Configure the `.devcontainer/recce/devcontainer.json`
    ```json
    {
        "name": "Recce CodeSpace",
        "build": {
            "dockerfile": "Dockerfile",
        },
        "containerEnv": {
            "RECCE_STATE_PASSWORD": "${{ secrets.RECCE_STATE_PASSWORD }}",
            "DBT_USER": "${{ secrets.DBT_USER }}",
            "DBT_PASSWORD": "${{ secrets.DBT_PASSWORD }}",
        },
        "forwardPorts": [8000],
        "postStartCommand": "recce server --cloud --review"
    }
    ```
    The secrets are Github Codespaces secrets. You can configure them in
    - [Account specific codespaces secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/managing-your-codespaces/managing-your-account-specific-secrets-for-github-codespaces) 
    - or [Repository-level or organization-level codespaces secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/managing-codespaces-for-your-organization/managing-development-environment-secrets-for-your-repository-or-organization)

1. Prepare the `.devcontainer/Dockerfile`
    ```
    FROM mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/python:3.11

    RUN pip install dbt-bigquery~=1.7.0 recce
    ```
!!!Note

    The GitHub token [generated by codespace](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/default-environment-variables-for-your-codespace) is sufficient for Recce's use. It's not necessary to configure the `GITHUB_TOKEN` separately.

## How to use

Here, we [use GitHub Codespaces for pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/using-github-codespaces-for-pull-requests)

1. Go to the GitHub PR page that is going to be reviewed
1. Click the **Code** button and create a Codespace on the PR branch
   ![alt text](../../assets/images/recce-cloud/setup-codespaces-pr.png){: .shadow}
1. Starting a Codespace instance usually takes one to several minutes.
1. When the Recce instance starts, an **Open Browser** notification will appear. Click the button to open the Recce web UI in a new tab.
1. Or you can go to the **PORTS** tab to open the page.


## Troubleshooting

When you’ve opened a Codespace but are unable to connect to the Recce instance, you can troubleshoot by following these steps:

1. Enter the Codespace instance
1. Click on the blue block in the lower left corner of the status bar, which usually shows "Codespaces: instance name"   
    ![alt text](../../assets/images/recce-cloud/codespace-troubleshoot-1.png)
1. Select "View creation log"
1. At this point, you should be able to see the reason why the Recce server failed to start.   
    ![alt text](../../assets/images/recce-cloud/codespace-troubleshoot-2.png)

Common causes might include:

1. The current branch does not have a corresponding pull request. This usually happens when the Codespace is opened on the main branch or for a closed PR.
1. The pull request does not have an uploaded Recce state. In review mode, the Recce state must be prepared via CI or locally before proceeding.
1. The `RECCE_STATE_PASSWORD` mentioned above is not set or the password is incorrect.
1. Other issues are preventing the Recce server from starting at all.

If this is your first time setting up a Codespace, it’s recommended to first [test locally](./getting-started-recce-cloud.md#review-the-pr) with the following commands:

```shell
git checkout feature/recce-getting-started
export GITHUB_TOKEN=<github-token>
export RECCE_STATE_PASSWORD=mypassword
recce server --cloud --review
```

Ensure it runs correctly locally. If it does, then the remaining issues within the Codespace are likely related to its configuration.

## FAQ

**Q: How long does Codespace generally take to start?**

The typical startup time is around 1 to 2 minutes. However, this depends on how your Dockerfile is configured. Codespace builds your image every time it starts, so if your Dockerfile includes multiple pip install <packages>, it may take longer.

Once your Codespace instance is already running, you won’t need to wait again when you return to it.

**Q: Is there a way to optimize the startup speed?**

Codespace offers a [prebuild](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/prebuilding-your-codespaces) feature, which can significantly improve startup speed. However, you need to ensure that the image is up-to-date. To strike a balance between speed and update frequency, you can consider scheduling a weekly image rebuild.

**Q: Can a Codespace environment be shared? Can different people access the same Codespace instance?**

A Codespace environment is tied to each individual GitHub user account. Therefore, a Codespace instance opened by User A cannot be directly accessed by User B. However, User A can set a specific port to be public and [share the URL with others](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/forwarding-ports-in-your-codespace#sharing-a-port). However, the instance is still running under User A's account.

**Q: Personal Codespace vs. Organization Codespace? How is Codespace billed?**

By default, Codespace usage is billed to a GitHub personal account. GitHub offers a free tier, allowing each user 120 core hours per month for free.

For GitHub organization accounts, you can configure all Codespace charges to be billed to the organization. In this case, billing is attributed to the organization rather than personal accounts.

For more details on billing, please refer to the official [CodeSpace billing documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces).


**Q: How to configure codespaces?**

Codespace utilizes VSCode Dev Containers technology, which can be executed either locally (via Docker) or in the cloud (via GitHub Codespace). The configuration above provided are primarily recommendations for the recce cloud setup. For more advanced configuration options, you can refer to the [VSCode dev containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) or the [containers.dev](https://containers.dev/) documentation.

The default configuration for GitHub Codespace is explained in the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/adding-a-dev-container-configuration/introduction-to-dev-containers). If you're looking to set up a development environment for dbt/Recce, you can also refer to the [Python project configuration documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/adding-a-dev-container-configuration/setting-up-your-python-project-for-codespaces).

**Q: Can I have multiple devcontainer configurations? Which one is selected by default?**

Yes, you can. Please refer to the [Codespaces documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/adding-a-dev-container-configuration/introduction-to-dev-containers#creating-a-custom-dev-container-configuration) for more details. Recce Cloud will prioritize `.devcontainer/recce/devcontainer.json` if it is available. If not, it will default to `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`, and then any other available configurations.
