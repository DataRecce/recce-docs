# Lineage Diff

Lineage Diff is the main interface to Recce and how you can quickly determine the zone of impact of any modeling changes. it's from Lineage Diff that you will determine which models to investigate further to validate your changes.

Models are color coded to indicate `added`, `removed`, and `modified` models.
