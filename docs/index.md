# Recce

Recce is pull request (PR) review tool designed for dbt projects.  Recce enables you to perform validation checks of you modeling changes by comparing two environments, such as development and production, and use these checks to build better pull request comments.

## What's a `Recce`
Recce, pronounced 'reh-key', is short for reconnaissance. We chose this name because Recce is used to explore and assess the impact of your modeling changes on data.

Add a 'Data Recce' to your workflow to stop pushing breaking changes to production.
