## What Does SOC 2 Type 1 Compliance Mean?

Developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), SOC 2 (System and Organization Controls) is an industry-leading standard designed to ensure companies manage customer data securely. A SOC 2 Type 1 audit evaluates and confirms that an organization has robust security controls, policies, and practices in place at a specific point in time.
