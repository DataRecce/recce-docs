# Meet Recce at Data Council and Data Reboot, Data Renegades Happy Hour
[Data Council](https://www.datacouncil.ai/bay-2025) is one of our favorite conferences: thousands of Data & AI practitioners, hundreds of cutting-edge talks, and endless opportunities to connect and be inspired. If you're in the data space, it's the event you don’t want to miss.

At Recce, we love talking to people who’ve encountered the challenges we’re passionate about. We believe data development is fundamentally different from software development. Yes, modern data teams borrow practices from software — version control, CI/CD, testing. But data comes with ambiguity. A 0.5% change in daily active customers might not mean much without business context. Is it correct? Is it broken? It depends.

<!-- more -->

More and more data teams are feeling this. Reviewing a SQL snippet isn’t enough.Context matters. How do teams work with the business to spot the real impact of changes? How do we prevent bad data from slipping into production unnoticed?

To explore these questions and meet fellow data practitioners, we’re hosting two events at Data Council 2025:

### Monday: Data Reboot — Lightning Talks + Happy Hour
