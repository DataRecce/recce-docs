## Model Changes and Impact Analysis

Recce shows what changed between **base** and **current** environments and helps assess potential impact. The most common case is comparing your development branch against your production or main branch to see what your changes will impact. 

You can: 

- Explore with the pre-loaded Jaffle Shop data
- Upload your metadata (see below)
- **Skip manual upload go directly to [CI/CD automation](#cicd-automation)**

### Upload Metadata
- Web interface: Click "Update" on the session you want to update in Recce Cloud.
    1. Click "Update" in base session to upload baseline metadata
    2. Click "Update" in current session to upload comparison metadata
    3. Click "Launch" to compare current against base
- CLI command:
```
recce upload-session --session-id <your_session_id>
```
Find your session ID in Recce Cloud web interface when clicking "Update" on any session.

### Required Files

Recce needs `manifest.json` and `catalog.json` from both **base** and **current** environments for comparison.

#### Base Metadata

Production environment is commonly used as the baseline, but any environment can serve as the base.

Choose one method:

**Method 1: Generate locally**

```
dbt docs generate --target-path target-base --target <your_prod_target>
```


**Method 2: dbt Cloud**<br>
Deploy â†’ Jobs â†’ Production job â†’ Recent run â†’ Download artifacts

**Method 3: dbt Docs server**<br>
Download the artifacts directly from dbt docs server:

- `<dbt_docs_url>/manifest.json`
- `<dbt_docs_url>/catalog.json`

#### Current Metadata

Use development environment or PR branch as current to compare against the base.

Choose one method:

**Method 1: Generate locally**

```
dbt docs generate --target <your_dev_target>
```

**Method 2: dbt Cloud**<br>
Deploy â†’ Jobs â†’ CI job â†’ Recent run â†’ Download artifacts


## Data Warehouse Diffing {#data-diffing}

Go beyond metadata to see how changes affect your actual data. Configure your data warehouse connection to compare query results and catch issues before they impact production.

### Setup Requirements

- Data warehouse credentials with read access
- Network connectivity to your warehouse
- Base and current environments configured in previous step

### Supported Warehouses

- Snowflake
- Databricks
- Others coming in future releases

### Warehouse Connection

Configure connection to your data warehouse to enable query result comparisons. For detailed connection settings, see [Connect to Warehouse](../5-data-diffing/connect-to-warehouse.md).

**Connection setup:**

1. Navigate to your [project home](https://cloud.datarecce.io/)
2. Find the **Warehouse Connection** section and click the gear icon
3. Choose one of the following options:
   - **Create new connection**: Click "Create New Connection" to set up a new warehouse connection and link it to your project
   - **Select existing**: If your organization already has warehouse connections, select one from the dropdown and click "Save"
4. Your connection is now linked and ready to use

**Managing connections:**

To update or change your project's warehouse connection:

1. Click the gear icon next to **Warehouse Connection** in your project home
2. In the connection management dialog:
   - **Switch connection**: Select a different connection from the dropdown and click "Save"
   - **Create new**: Click "Create New Connection" to add and link a new warehouse connection
   - **Remove connection**: Select "No Connection" from the dropdown and click "Save"

**Quick tips:**

- New connections are automatically linked to your project when created from project home
- You can manage all organization warehouse connections from [settings](https://cloud.reccehq.com/settings#organization){target="_blank"}
- Connection credentials are encrypted and secure. See our [security practices](https://reccehq.com/security/){target="_blank"} for details
