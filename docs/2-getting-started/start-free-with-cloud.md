## Step 1: Get Ready to Launch Recce

### Upload your artifacts

- **Best if**: You want to try without GitHub permissions
- **You get**: Launch Recce with your actual dbt project
- **Setup**: Upload your development and production artifacts locally
- **Immediate value**: See your real project lineage and metadata diffs
- âœ¨ **You'll know it's working when**: Your models appear in the lineage graph

<br>
If you don't have a dbt project, you can just click "Launch" to see the Jaffle Shop sample project loaded.

### Connect to view all your PR

- **Best if**: You have a current PR and GitHub permissions
- **You get**: List all your PRs and validate any of them
- **Setup**: Connect GitHub (installs Recce app) and upload your PR snapshots
- **Immediate value**: See all PRs and do validation
- âœ¨ **You'll know it's working when**: Your PRs appear in a the project

## Step 2: Launch Recce â†’ See Metadata Diffing

**What you just unlocked**:

- âœ… **Lineage visualization** of your models
- âœ… **Metadata comparison** between changes and production
- âœ… **Change detection** automatically highlighted
- âœ… **Column-level impact analysis**

**You can now**: Explore which models changed and understand downstream impact

âœ¨ **You'll know it's working when**: You see colored nodes showing changed models in the lineage view

## Step 3: Unlock Data Diffing â†’ Real Data Validation

- **What you'll unlock**: Compare actual data between development and production
- **Setup needed**: Configure your data warehouse connection (1 action)
- **New value**:
  - âœ… **Value diff** - see row count changes
  - âœ… **Profile diff** - compare data distributions
  - âœ… **Schema diff** - spot structure changes
  - âœ… **Custom query comparisons** - run any SQL side-by-side

**You can now**: Validate that your data changes work correctly

âœ¨ **You'll know it's working when**: You can run "Value Diff" and see actual row count comparisons

## Step 4: Automate Everything â†’ CI/CD Integration

- **What you'll unlock**: Automatic validation on every PR
- **Setup needed**: [Set up automated workflows](../7-cicd/scenario-ci.md)
- **Ultimate value**:
