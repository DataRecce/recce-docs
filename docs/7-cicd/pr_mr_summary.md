title: AI Summary
---

When the CI task is executed, it generates a lineage and checks report for your PR/MR. However, the report uses a fixed format and lacks PR-specific context.

AI Summary leverages state-of-the-art AI agents to understand your changes by analyzing your PR information and updated metadata. It proactively thinks and decides what to validate by data diffing in your data warehouse, then provides comprehensive insights to help you make informed decisions.

Features
- Automatically identify what to validate
- Explore changes through data diffing in Recce
- Generate actionable insights to guide your merge decision

## How to Use
